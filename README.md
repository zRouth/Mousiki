#Mousik√≠ Find the Music you Love in the City you Live!

Mousiki is an application that combines Spotify and Songkick into one easy to
use website. Songkick is a website that allows you to track artists and see
when those artists come to play a show in your city. Spotify is an application
that allows you to listen to almost any music you want. So if you have a
Spotify account and a songkick account you can log into both of those and
this application will automatically populate the songkick with the songs you
have saved on spotify and you will always know when the music you listen to
comes to to play in the city that you live!
